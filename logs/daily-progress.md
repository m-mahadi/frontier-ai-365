## Warmup Day 0: Dec 20, 2025
**Focus:** Breaking the "Black Box" of Neural Networks

### 🧠 Today's Progress
* **Conceptual Deep Dive:** Completed **3Blue1Brown’s** "But what is a neural network?" to visualize how high-dimensional data is transformed across layers.
* **Computer Vision Foundations:** Watched **Welch Labs'** *Learning to See* (1-16), bridging the gap between biological vision and machine perception.
* **Implementation Math:** Finished **Welch Labs'** *Neural Networks Demystified* (1-7) to see the literal Python implementation of the fundamental neural network.

### 💡 Key Insights
* **Simplicity at Scale:** It is astonishing that the "intelligence" of an LLM is essentially an emergent property of billions of simple linear transformations.
* **The "Cheat" for NP-Problems:** Realized that AI doesn't mathematically solve NP-hard problems; it uses heuristics to find near-optimal solutions efficiently.
* **Stack Alignment:** Traditional ML felt like a dead-end for my stack, but understanding these foundations is necessary to master high-level LLM orchestration (RAG/Agents).

### 🏁 Status
* **Current Mode:** Warmup / NSU Exam Preparation.
* **Official Kickoff:** Dec 27th.
